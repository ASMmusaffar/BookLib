# BookLib
 The Book Library is an intuitive web application that allows users to manage a collection of books. Users can add books with details such as name, author, genre, and description, and also have the ability to delete books from the list. The project utilizes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with a modern and responsive design using Flexbox for layout.
